# Notes

Interpreting "Output Specification: `Hello, World!`, 3 times, on three different lines."
almost the dumbest way possible, that is to say, as:

- printing `Hello, World!` 3 times, each time on a new line, but without ending the last line;
- and also code-wise: multiple `cout`-s, without using a loop.

â‡’ Wrong answer :(

## Some concepts

* standard library, namespace,
* `main` function, and its `return` value,
* standard output stream (`cout`, `<<`, `endl`).
