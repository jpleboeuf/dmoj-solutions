# Notes

Interpreting "Output Specification: `Hello, World!`, 3 times, on three different lines."
almost the dumbest way possible (another take, variation of the third take in Try 05), that is to say, as:

- printing `Hello, World!` 3 times, each time on a new line, but back to putting each `endl` at the end of each new line instead of the start;
- also, code-wise: it's Try 05, but still following the trend started in Try 07, of using a string variable.

Similar to Try 05, but using a string variable.

## Some concepts

* standard library, namespace,
* `main` function, and its `return` value,
* standard output stream (`cout`, `<<`, `endl`).
