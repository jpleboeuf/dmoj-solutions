# Notes

Interpreting "Output Specification: `Hello, World!`, 3 times, on three different lines."
the dumbest way possible (fourth take, small variation of the third take in Try 05), that is to say, as:

- printing `Hello, World!` 3 times, each time on a new line;
- and also code-wise: removing the explicit `return 0;` at the end of the code, and still without using a loop.

Similar to Try 05, but without `return 0` at the end of the code.

## Some concepts

* standard library, namespace,
* `main` function, and its `return` value,
* standard output stream (`cout`, `<<`, `endl`).
