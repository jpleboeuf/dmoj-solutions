# Notes

Interpreting "Output Specification: `Hello, World!`, 3 times, on three different lines."
in a smarter way but still dumb, that is to say, as:

- printing `Hello, World!` 3 times, each time on a new line, but prefixing each new line with "N. " where N is the line number, therefore also making each line different.

## Some concepts

* standard library, namespace,
* `main` function, and its `return` value,
* standard output stream (`cout`, `<<`, `endl`).
