# Notes

Interpreting "Output Specification: `Hello, World!`, 3 times, on three different lines."
in a smarter way but very hacky (second take), that is to say, as:

- printing `Hello, World!` 3 times, each time on a new line, but using a different eol on each line, therefore also making each line different, using `\n` on the first line, `\r\n` on the second line, and `\n\r` on the last line.

â‡’ Wrong answer :(

## Some concepts

* standard library, namespace,
* `main` function, and its `return` value,
* standard output stream (`cout`, `<<`, `endl`).
