# Notes

Interpreting "Output Specification: `Hello, World!`, 3 times, on three different lines."
almost the dumbest way possible (another take, similar to Try 04), that is to say, as:

- printing `Hello, World!` 3 times, each time on a new line, back to ending the last line (it's a variation of Try 04, the code is a bit different, like Try 08);
- and also code-wise: still replacing the `endl`-s by `\n`-s, and still using only one `cout`, but still without using a loop.

Similar to Try 04, but using a string variable.

## Some concepts

* standard library, namespace,
* `main` function, and its `return` value,
* standard output stream (`cout`, `<<`, `endl`).
