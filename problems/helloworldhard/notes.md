# Notes

Interpreting "Output Specification: `Hello, World!`, 3 times, on three different lines."
the dumbest way possible (second take, variation of the first take in Try 01), that is to say, as:

- printing `Hello, World!` 3 times, each time on a new line;
- and also code-wise: replacing the `endl`-s by `\n`-s, and still without using a loop.

Similar to Try 01, but using explicitely `\n` as eol, and not using a loop anymore.

## Some concepts

* standard library, namespace,
* `main` function, and its `return` value,
* standard output stream (`cout`, `<<`, `endl`).
