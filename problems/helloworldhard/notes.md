# Notes

Interpreting "Output Specification: `Hello, World!`, 3 times, on three different lines."
almost the dumbest way possible, that is to say, as:

- printing `Hello, World!` 3 times, each time on a new line, but putting each `endl` at the beginning of each new line instead of the end;
- also code-wise: thus back to using `endl`-s instead of `\n`-s, and still back to using 3 `cout`-s, still without using a loop.

â‡’ Wrong answer :(

## Some concepts

* standard library, namespace,
* `main` function, and its `return` value,
* standard output stream (`cout`, `<<`, `endl`).
