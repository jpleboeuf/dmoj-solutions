# Notes

Not much to say because a solution is given alongside the problem, and my solution doesn't deviate too much from it.

I can comment that I plan not to use the `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` shortcut to include all C++ standard libraries.

See Stack Overflow: "[Why should I not #include <bits/stdc++.h>?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31816095/why-should-i-not-include-bits-stdc-h)".

## Some concepts

* standard library, namespace,
* `main` function, and its `return` value,
* standard output stream (`cout`, `<<`, `endl`),
* standard input stream (`cin`, `>>`).
